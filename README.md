# work-day-scheduler

For this project, I modified an existing repository so that when the Work Day Scheduler page is loaded, the date appears at the top and a scheduler displaying the standard workday hours appears.  I was provided an index.html and style.css files as starting points and needed to add on to the html file and then create a corresponding script.js file to perform different actions on the page.  I color-coded each row, using functions, based on if that hour is in the past (gray), current hour block (red), or future (green).  I also needed to create functions that would allow the user to input text and then click the save button, saving it in the Scheduler.  Finally, I needed to save the content to local storage so that the tasks logged would be saved and displayed when the page is refreshed.

Content is saved to local storage and accessible even when the page is refreshed:
